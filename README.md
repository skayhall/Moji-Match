## Learning Notes

- vue instance = HTML is the entry point, but everything happens within the created Vue instance.
- v-for = use to create lists
- v-if = if statements/conditionals
- v-bind = special attributes provided by Vue that apply special reactive behavior to the DOM. Binds an attribute to an expression.
- v-on = handle user unput. attach event listeners that invoke methods on a vuew instance
- Best to use the public folder when...
    - Lots of images need their paths synamically referenced
- We can pass an object to v-bind:class to dynamically toggle classes
